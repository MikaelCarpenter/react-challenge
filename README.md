# React Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Start the app + open it in browser:

```bash
npm start
```

**Context**

This is a SPA with `App.tsx` being the root.

There are two pages: 

    - List: displays the list of todos and allows you to complete them. Clicking on a todo's text will navigate to the detail view.
    - Detail: displays some info about the todo you clicked.


## Prompt

There are two issues in the app. The first one is simple, fix the checkboxes. The second one you should discover yourself and fix.
